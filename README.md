# Course
"Data Mining" course - last year of Bachelor degree
COURSE GOALS: Give an introduction to the main machine learning models for regression and classification tasks

# Project
Our work focuses on heart attacks, one of the most common cardiovascular diseases, specifically on predicting the risk of a heart attack using data mining tools. The goal is to identify the best classification method to estimate the likelihood of a heart attack using techniques like KNN and logistic regression. The analysis results show that logistic regression is the most effective method, although further research is needed to address some issues encountered. These findings can be useful in both diagnostic and healthcare economic contexts.
